The indices, which are updated every Friday, show that the total number of jobs advertised online in Switzerland was around 7% lower in mid-December than in mid-October. However, firms still have a large number of unfilled positions in a historical perspective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDec 12, 2022\n\n\nMichael Siegenthaler\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nSwiss Job Tracker 1.0 released\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject News\n\n\n\n\nToday, we launch swissjobtracker.ch.

    "text": "Today’s update of the job indices published on swissjobtracker.ch fixes an unfavorable feature of the job indexes we have published to date. An evaluation of the indicator revealed that the series exhibit a systematic downward bias for the most recently published values - the latest index values thus signaled a systematically worse development on the job market than was actually the case.\nThe reason for this was a property of the real-time data: some of the job advertisements that were considered deleted in the latest week were found again by the webcrawler in subsequent weeks. These job ads were reactivated. While the reactivations primarily concerned advertisements from the previous week, reactivations affected up to 5% of all vacancies from a previous week. The upward revisions also concerned values published 2-5 weeks ago, but the share of affected vacancies became smaller and smaller. The consequence of the reactivations were systematic upward revisions of the job index values in the weeks after the first publication of an index value.\nOur solution to this problem is to simply prevent reactivations in the future by storing vintages of the vacancy data: The vacancy stock used to compute the index in a given week consist of the job advertisements that were active on the Friday of that week. The data remain “frozen” in subsequent weeks when a new value is computed. Therefore, a vacancy that has been deleted in a given week is also considered as deleted in the following weeks even it is found again by the crawler. An additional benefit of this approach is that the index values once published remain identical for the same week in subsequent weekly releases.\n\n\n\nSwiss job tracker: Index of Job Postings on Friday 14, 2023\n\n\nThe revised job indices continue to point to a very good labor market situation in Switzerland. Websites and job portals contain about 56% more vacancies than in January 2020, which serves as the reference value of the series."

    "text": "Swiss Job Tracker is a new job market index for Switzerland that is updated weekly. It tracks the development of all job postings advertised on company websites and job portals in Switzerland. On Friday of the second week of December, the weekly job market index for the overall economy stood at 157 index points. This index value means that 57% more jobs were advertised on December 9 than in January 2020. January 2020, shortly before the outbreak of the Corona pandemic, serves as the reference point for the index.\nWhile the current situation on the Swiss job market thus remains very good for jobseekers in a longer-run perspective, the new real-time indices indicate a slight deterioration of the job market in the last few weeks. In mid-October, the index value had been above 168 points (or 68% above the pre-pandemic level). The total number of jobs advertised on online sources thus decreased by around 7% in two months. The slight decline in job postings over the course of several weekly releases of the job indices is probably a sign of the deteriorating Swiss economy. Another driver is seasonal: there is typically less demand for personnel in the tourism industry in November than in October due to the shoulder season.\n\n\n\nSwiss job tracker: Unique job postings in Switzerland\n\n\nThe new job indices can also be broken down by canton, industry and occupation. The industry-level indices indicate that the decline in the overall index stems from a broader decline of online job postings in most industries. As you would expect if the World economy moves into a downturn, the decline in recent weeks is somewhat more pronounced in more export-oriented sectors such as manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and banking and insurance. The breadth of the decline indicates that we could see a broader-based normalization of the job market in the coming months. The only larger industry that, so far, shows little evidence for a decline in online vacancies is the human health and social work sector.\nAll job indices can be viewed and downloaded on the website www.swissjobtracker.ch. The data will henceforth be published every week on Friday at noon. The data basis and the calculation method of the indicator are described in detail here."

    "text": "Today, we present the first release of swissjobtracker.ch. The website is a new dashboard with labor market indicators that allow monitoring the Swiss labor market in real time. For this purpose, the dashboard provides and visualizes new high-frequency time series derived from large-scale online data sources. Users of the dashboard can generate figures of the time series, download the figures and the data, and access the complete source code of the dashboard.\nAlong this dashboard we release new and unique indicators on the state of the online job market in Switzerland. The indices measure how the number of unique online job postings in Switzerland change over time. The job indices can be broken down by industry, broad occupation, and canton. A central asset of these indices is the fact that we publish them on a weekly basis. Hence, the new job indices allow monitoring the state of the Swiss job market at a very high temporal frequency. The Covid crisis clearly showcased how important it is to have timely indicators of labor market activity.\nThe data used to construct these indices cover the near-universe of job postings in Switzerland published on job boards and firm websites. These data are collected by the private company x28 AG. x28 is specialized in collecting and synthesizing data from online job openings posted in Switzerland. Due to the importance of the online job market (Buchmann et al. 2022), the data cover close to 4 out of 5 job openings in Switzerland. Consequently, there exists a close correspondence between our new index of unique online job openings and the official vacancy index published by the Federal Statistical Office (see Figure below). Our indices also evolve similarly to those of official statistics in individual industries. However, our indices are published at a higher frequency and in real-time. While the indices cover a large number of job openings in all Swiss regions, the coverage of the German-speaking part may be slightly better than the coverage of the Latin-speaking parts of the country. A documentation that explains our new indices and shows how they compare with data from official statistics can be found here.\n\n\n\nCorrelation between our the new weekly index of unique online job postings and the official vacancy index of the Federal Statistical Office (BESTA)\n\n\nSwiss Job Tracker and the new indices of job openings for Switzerland were created as part of the project “What Workers Want: Determinants and Implications of Job Search Strategies on an Online Job Platform” within the Swiss National Science Foundation’s (SNSF) National Research Program on “Digital Transformation” (NRP-77). The dashboard resulted from a collaboration between members of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute of ETH Zurich and the University of Lausanne. We thank x28 AG for data provision and support in constructing the indices.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBuchmann, Marlis, Helen Buchs, Felix Busch, Simon Clematide, Ann-Sophie Gnehm, and Jan Müller. 2022. “Swiss Job Market Monitor: A Rich Source of Demand-Side Micro Data of the Labour Market.” European Sociological Review, January. https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcac002."
