description: New types of weekly job market data suggest that the big boom that has characterized the job market so far in 2022 may be fading. The new job indices, which will be updated every Friday from now on, show that the number of all jobs advertised online in Switzerland in mid-November was around 5% lower than in mid-October.

Swiss Job Tracker is a new type of job market index for Switzerland that is updated weekly. It tracks the development of all job postings advertised on company websites and job portals in Switzerland. At the end of the second week of November, the weekly job market index for the overall economy currently stood at 160 index points. This index value means that 60% more jobs were advertised on November 11 than in January 2020 - i.e., shortly before the outbreak of the Corona pandemic, which serves as the reference point for the index.

While the situation on the Swiss job market thus remains very good, the new real-time index indicates a slight deterioration in the labor market situation in the last few weeks. In mid-October, the index value had still been 168 points. Overall, the number of all jobs advertised online thus decreased by around 5% in one month. On the one hand, the decline is probably a sign of the deteriorating Swiss economy. On the other hand, the fact that there is typically less demand for personnel in November than in October due to the shoulder season in the tourism industry plays a certain role.

The dashboard resulted from a collaboration between members of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute of ETH Zurich and the University of Lausanne. We thank x28 AG for data provision and support in constructing the indices.
