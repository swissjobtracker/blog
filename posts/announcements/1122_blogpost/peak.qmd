description: New weekly job market indices suggest that the big boom that has characterized the Swiss job market in 2022 may be fading. The new job indices, which will be updated every Friday from now on, show that the number of jobs advertised online in Switzerland in mid-November was around 5% lower than in mid-October. However, firms still have a large number of unfilled positions in historical perspective.

Swiss Job Tracker is a new job market index for Switzerland that is updated weekly. It tracks the development of all job postings advertised on company websites and job portals in Switzerland. At the end of the second week of November, the weekly job market index for the overall economy stood at 160 index points. This index value means that 60% more jobs were advertised on November 11 than in January 2020. January 2020, shortly before the outbreak of the Corona pandemic, serves as the reference point for the index.

While the current situation on the Swiss job market thus remains very good for jobseekers in a longer-run perspective, the new real-time indices indicate a slight deterioration of the job market in the last few weeks. In mid-October, the index value had still been 168 points. The total number of jobs advertised on online sources thus decreased by around 5% in one month. The decline in job postings is probably a sign of the deteriorating Swiss economy. Another driver is seasonal: there is typically less demand for personnel in the tourism industry in November than in October due to the shoulder season.

The new job indices can also be broken down by canton, industry and occupation. The industry-level indices indicate that the decline in the overall index is attributable to several industries, of which many are more export-oriented. For example, we observe a slight decline in the number of unique job openings in recent weeks in manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation, and banking and insurance. The breadth of the decline indicates that we could see a broader-based normalization of the job market in the coming months.

All job indices can be viewed and downloaded on the website www.swissjobtracker.ch. The data will henceforth be published every week. The data basis and the calculation method of the indicator are described in detail [here](https://swissjobtracker.ch/#/about "Methodology swissjobtracker.ch").
